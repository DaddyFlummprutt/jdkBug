# PoC for showing error with Unsafe::getLongVolatile() on Apple Silicon

## Introduction
We are using Agrona and using `UnsafeBuffer::getLongVolatile()` caused an internal error (SIGBUS) on Apple M1 & Apple M2  
using Apple Silicon M1 and Apple Silicon M2 cpu:s.
Further investigation showed that the problem really is with `Unsafe::getLongVolatile()`  
and more specifically, with the `Volatile` semantics. `Unsafe::getLong()` works as expected.  
Some further testing showed that `Unsafe::getDoubleVolatile()` also fails while `getIntVolatile()`  
and `getBoolVolatile()` also works which indicates that it is a 64 bit problem.

We have reported this to Oracle bug reporting (and failed to note down the issue number given)

Addendum: Aleksey Shipilev has pointed out that the `UnsafeBuffer::getLongVolatile()` is unaligned which is correct. Aligning the read  
on a 8 byte boundary works.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SIGBUS on unaligned atomic load is the valid result for many architectures, ARM64 included. Modern versions of JVM handle it a bit better, but this is still a programming error, not a JVM bug. If you are using Unsafe, you are opting into handling hardware quirks yourself.</p>&mdash; Aleksey ShipilÃ«v (@shipilev) <a href="https://twitter.com/shipilev/status/1648705945172692994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

However, the code in question works fine on the following JDK:s:

- ARM Temurin JDK 11
- x86-64 Temurin JDK 17
- x86-64 GraalVM JDK 17

and fails on:

- ARM Temurin JDK 17
- ARM Zulu JDK 17

The problem is presend in JDK 15 but not in JDK 13 so my take is that something in the JVM changed since 13.
